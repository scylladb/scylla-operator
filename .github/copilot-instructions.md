## Copilot Instructions for ScyllaDB Operator

The commit message should always (no exceptions) be an imperative sentence without a trailing dot. Some examples:
* "Document automatic data cleanups"
* "Add IPv6 support for ScyllaClusters"
* "Reword platforms to environments"
* "Update maintainers in the Helm charts"

Prefer commit message length under 72 characters.

The commit message should never include "@mentions" or hashtag ("#") references. The commit message should never include [keywords that close issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

The PR title should follow the same rules as the commit message.
