## Unreleased

### Dependencies

- Updated ScyllaDB Monitoring (`github.com/scylladb/scylla-monitoring` git submodule) from `4.14.0` (`88dd086`) pre-release version
  to the final `4.14.0` (`9dcb579`). The update includes several Grafana dashboard improvements and bug fixes, as well as
  a patch update to the Grafana image used (`docker.io/grafana/grafana` from `12.3.2` to `12.3.3`).
  [#3282](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/pull/3282), [#3284](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/pull/3284

### Bug fixes

- Made sure that ScyllaDBMonitoring-deployed ServiceMonitors have an explicit scrape interval of 5s, which is the recommended
  default for ScyllaDB monitoring. Also, adjusted the Grafana dashboard data source configuration to use 30s as the default
  scrape interval for queries to ensure there are no issues with missing data points in the graphs.
  Please note this change may affect your setup if you have an external Prometheus instance configured with a global scrape
  interval - from now on it will be overridden by the ServiceMonitor configuration generated by the operator.
