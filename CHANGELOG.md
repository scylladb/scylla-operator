## Unreleased

### API Changes

- Extended the admission webhook to emit warnings when ScyllaCluster's backup or repair task names do not adhere to RFC 1123
  subdomain requirements. Invalid task names currently cause silent failures where the underlying ScyllaDBManagerTask objects fail to be created.
  **In the next minor release, these warnings will become validation errors that prevent ScyllaCluster creation or updates.**
  Users must update their resources to comply with the requirements.
  [#3295](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/pull/3295)

### Dependencies

- Updated ScyllaDB Monitoring (`github.com/scylladb/scylla-monitoring` git submodule) from `4.14.0` (`88dd086`) pre-release version
  to the final `4.14.0` (`9dcb579`). The update includes several Grafana dashboard improvements and bug fixes, as well as
  a patch update to the Grafana image used (`docker.io/grafana/grafana` from `12.3.2` to `12.3.3`).
  [#3282](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/pull/3282), [#3284](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/pull/3284

### Bug fixes

- Made sure that ScyllaDBMonitoring-deployed ServiceMonitors have an explicit scrape interval of 5s, which is the recommended
  default for ScyllaDB monitoring. Also, adjusted the Grafana dashboard data source configuration to use 30s as the default
  scrape interval for queries to ensure there are no issues with missing data points in the graphs.
  Please note this change may affect your setup if you have an external Prometheus instance configured with a global scrape
  interval - from now on it will be overridden by the ServiceMonitor configuration generated by the operator.
