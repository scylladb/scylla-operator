[Scylla Operator](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator) is a Kubernetes Operator for managing and automating tasks related to managing ScyllaDB clusters.

[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com) is a close-to-the-hardware rewrite of Cassandra in C++. It features a shared nothing architecture that enables true linear scaling and major hardware optimizations that achieve ultra-low latencies and extreme throughput. It is a drop-in replacement for Cassandra and uses the same interfaces.

## Deploying the Operator
For version requirements see the [support matrix](./docs/source/support/releases.md).

### GitOps
Kubernetes manifests are located in the `deploy/` folder. To deploy the operator manually using Kubernetes manifests or to integrate it into your GitOps flow please follow [these instructions](./deploy/README.md). 

### Helm Charts
You can also use Helm charts to deploy both Scylla Operator and Scylla clusters:

#### Stable
```bash
helm repo add scylla-operator https://storage.googleapis.com/scylla-operator-charts/stable
```

#### Latest
```bash
helm repo add scylla-operator https://storage.googleapis.com/scylla-operator-charts/latest
```


## Quickstarts and Training
To quickly deploy a ScyllaCluster, you can choose one of the following options:

* [GKE](./docs/source/quickstarts/gke.md): This is a quickstart guide to help you set up a basic [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) cluster quickly with local NVMes and solid performance.
* [EKS](./docs/source/quickstarts/eks.md): This is a quickstart guide to help you set up a basic [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster quickly with local NVMes and solid performance.
