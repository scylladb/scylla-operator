                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
