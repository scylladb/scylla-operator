   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description
   * - cron
     - string
     - cron specifies the task schedule as a cron expression. It supports the "standard" cron syntax `MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW`, as used by the Linux utility, as well as a set of non-standard macros: "@yearly", "@annually", "@monthly", "@weekly", "@daily", "@midnight", "@hourly", "@every [+-]?<duration>".
   * - dc
     - array (string)
     - dc specifies a list of datacenter `glob` patterns, e.g. `dc1`, `!otherdc*`, determining the datacenters to include or exclude from backup.
   * - keyspace
     - array (string)
     - keyspace specifies a list of `glob` patterns used to include or exclude tables from backup. The patterns match keyspaces and tables. Keyspace names are separated from table names with a dot e.g. `!keyspace.table_prefix_*`.
   * - location
     - array (string)
     - location specifies a list of backup locations in the following format: `[<dc>:]<provider>:<name>`. `<dc>:` is optional and allows to specify the location for a datacenter in a multi-datacenter cluster. `<provider>` specifies the storage provider. `<name>` specifies a bucket name and must be an alphanumeric string which may contain a dash and or a dot, but other characters are forbidden.
   * - numRetries
     - integer
     - numRetries specifies how many times a scheduled task should be retried before failing.
   * - rateLimit
     - array (string)
     - rateLimit specifies the limit for the upload rate, expressed in mebibytes (MiB) per second, at which the snapshot files can be uploaded from a ScyllaDB node to its backup destination, in the following format: `[<dc>:]<limit>`. `<dc>:` is optional and allows for specifying different upload limits in selected datacenters.
   * - retention
     - integer
     - retention specifies the number of backups to store.
   * - retryWait
     - string
     - retryWait specifies the initial exponential backoff duration for task retries. For instance, if set to 10 minutes, the first retry will be attempted after 10 minutes, the second after 20 minutes, the third after 40 minutes, and so on, up to the number of retries specified in `numRetries`. If not set, the default values is left to ScyllaDB Manager to decide.
   * - snapshotParallel
     - array (string)
     - snapshotParallel specifies a list of snapshot parallelism limits in the following format:  `[<dc>:]<limit>`. `<dc>:` is optional and allows for specifying different limits in selected datacenters. If `<dc>:` is not set, the limit is global. For instance, `[]string{"dc1:2", "5"}` corresponds to two parallel nodes in `dc1` datacenter and five parallel nodes in the other datacenters.
   * - startDate
     - string
     - startDate specifies the start date of the task. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. If not set, the task is started immediately.
   * - uploadParallel
     - array (string)
     - uploadParallel specifies a list of upload parallelism limits in the following format: `[<dc>:]<limit>`. `<dc>:` is optional and allows for specifying different limits in selected datacenters. If `<dc>:` is not set, the limit is global. For instance, `[]string{"dc1:2", "5"}` corresponds to two parallel nodes in `dc1` datacenter and five parallel nodes in the other datacenters.

   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description
   * - cron
     - string
     - cron specifies the task schedule as a cron expression. It supports the "standard" cron syntax `MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW`, as used by the Linux utility, as well as a set of non-standard macros: "@yearly", "@annually", "@monthly", "@weekly", "@daily", "@midnight", "@hourly", "@every [+-]?<duration>".
   * - dc
     - array (string)
     - dc specifies a list of datacenter `glob` patterns, e.g. `dc1`, `!otherdc*`, determining the datacenters to include or exclude from repair.
   * - failFast
     - boolean
     - failFast indicates that a repair should be stopped on first encountered error.
   * - host
     - string
     - host specifies the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a node to repair. Specifying this field limits repair to token ranges replicated by a given node. When used in conjunction with `dc`, the node must belong to the specified datacenters. If not set, all hosts are repaired.
   * - ignoreDownHosts
     - boolean
     - ignoreDownHosts indicates that the nodes in down state should be ignored during repair.
   * - intensity
     - integer
     - intensity specifies the number of token ranges to repair in a single ScyllaDB node at the same time. Changing the intensity impacts the repair granularity in case it is resumed. The higher the value, the more work on resumption. When set to zero, the number of token ranges is adjusted to the maximum supported number. When set to a value greater than the maximum supported by the node, intensity is capped at the maximum supported value. Refer to repair documentation for details.
   * - keyspace
     - array (string)
     - keyspace specifies a list of `glob` patterns used to include or exclude tables from repair. The patterns match keyspaces and tables. Keyspace names are separated from table names with a dot e.g. `!keyspace.table_prefix_*`.
   * - numRetries
     - integer
     - numRetries specifies how many times a scheduled task should be retried before failing.
   * - parallel
     - integer
     - parallel specifies the maximum number of ScyllaDB repair jobs that can run at the same time (on different token ranges and replicas). Each node can take part in at most one repair at any given moment. By default, or when set to zero, the maximum possible parallelism is used. The maximal effective parallelism depends on keyspace replication strategy and cluster topology. When set to a value greater than the maximum supported by the node, parallel is capped at the maximum supported value. Refer to repair documentation for details.
   * - retryWait
     - string
     - retryWait specifies the initial exponential backoff duration for task retries. For instance, if set to 10 minutes, the first retry will be attempted after 10 minutes, the second after 20 minutes, the third after 40 minutes, and so on, up to the number of retries specified in `numRetries`. If not set, the default values is left to ScyllaDB Manager to decide.
   * - smallTableThreshold
     - 
     - smallTableThreshold enables small table optimization for tables of size lower than the given threshold.
   * - startDate
     - string
     - startDate specifies the start date of the task. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. If not set, the task is started immediately.

     - string
     - reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
