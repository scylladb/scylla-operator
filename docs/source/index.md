:title: Scylla Operator
:image: /_static/mascots/logo.svg

{{productName}} project helps users to run ScyllaDB on Kubernetes. 
It extends the Kubernetes APIs using [CustomResourceDefinitions(CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) and runs controllers that reconcile the desired state declared using these APIs.
```

```

```{note}
{{productName}} works with both ScyllaDB Open Source and ScyllaDB Enterprise. By default, our examples use ScyllaDB Open Source. To make the switch to ScyllaDB Enterprise, you only have to [change the ScyllaCluster image repository](#scyllacluster-enterprise) and [adjust the ScyllaDB utils image using ScyllaOperatorConfig](resources/scyllaoperatorconfigs.md#tuning-with-scylladb-enterprise).
