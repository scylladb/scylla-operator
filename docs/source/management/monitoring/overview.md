# ScyllaDB Monitoring overview

## Architecture

ScyllaDB [exposes](https://monitoring.docs.scylladb.com/stable/reference/monitoring-apis.html) its metrics in the Prometheus format. 
{{productName}} provides the [`ScyllaDBMonitoring`](../../api-reference/groups/scylla.scylladb.com/scylladbmonitorings.rst) custom resource
that allows you to set up a complete monitoring stack for your ScyllaDB clusters based on the following components:

- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io) for metrics collection and alerting (along with scraping and alerting rules targeting ScyllaDB instances).
- [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com) for metrics visualization (with pre-configured dashboards for ScyllaDB).

:::{note}
The `ScyllaDBMonitoring` CRD is still in its `v1alpha1` version, yet it is considered stable and ready for production use, with
the following caveats:
- `spec.components.grafana.exposeOptions` and `spec.components.prometheus.exposeOptions` are deprecated and will be removed in the next API version,
- the **Managed** mode is deprecated; the **External** mode for Prometheus is likely to be the only supported mode in the next API version.

## Prometheus

For deploying and/or configuring Prometheus, {{productName}} relies on [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).

{{productName}} supports two modes of operation for `ScyllaDBMonitoring` regarding Prometheus deployment:
**Managed** and **External**. You can choose the mode that best fits your needs by setting the `spec.components.prometheus.mode` field in the `ScyllaDBMonitoring` resource.

Depending on the mode chosen, {{productName}} may deploy and manage a Prometheus instance for you, or it can be configured to use
an existing Prometheus instance (managed by the Prometheus Operator) in your cluster.

The following Prometheus Operator resources are created by {{productName}} when you deploy a `ScyllaDBMonitoring` resource:

- [`Prometheus`](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/e4c727291acc543dab531bc4aaf16637067c1b86/pkg/apis/monitoring/v1/prometheus_types.go#L1085) - the Prometheus instance itself (it may be omitted in External mode).
- [`ServiceMonitor`](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/e4c727291acc543dab531bc4aaf16637067c1b86/pkg/apis/monitoring/v1/servicemonitor_types.go#L41) - the resource that defines how to scrape metrics from ScyllaDB nodes.
- [`PrometheusRule`](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/e4c727291acc543dab531bc4aaf16637067c1b86/pkg/apis/monitoring/v1/prometheusrule_types.go#L37) - the resource that defines alerting rules for Prometheus.

The Prometheus version used in the deployment is tied to the version of {{productName}}. You can find the exact version used in the
[`config.yaml`](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/blob/master/assets/config/config.yaml) file under `operator.prometheusVersion` key.

### External

The **External** mode plugs into an existing Prometheus that is managed by Prometheus Operator (and therefore can be configured by `ServiceMonitor`).

In the **External** mode, {{productName}} will not deploy a `Prometheus` resource (will instead expect a running Prometheus in the cluster already), but it will still create the `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` resources
that an existing Prometheus Operator in your cluster will use to configure your Prometheus instance. This mode is useful if you already have a Prometheus instance
deployed in your cluster, and you want to use it for monitoring your ScyllaDB clusters. If you don't have Prometheus deployed in your cluster, you need to deploy one to proceed.

When using this mode, you need to ensure that the existing Prometheus instance is configured to discover and scrape the 
`ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` resources created by {{productName}}. Please refer to the [Setting up ScyllaDB Monitoring](setup.md#deploy-prometheus-instance) guide for more details.

Please note that in this mode, `ScyllaDBMonitoring` has to be configured so that Grafana can access the Prometheus instance.
You can configure Grafana datasources in the `spec.components.grafana.datasources` field of the `ScyllaDBMonitoring` resource.
Please refer to the [`ScyllaDBMonitoring` API reference](../../api-reference/groups/scylla.scylladb.com/scylladbmonitorings.rst) for details.

### Managed

:::{note}
This mode is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Instead, please deploy your own Prometheus and use **External**.
:::

In the **Managed** mode, {{productName}} will deploy a Prometheus instance for you. This is the default mode.
What this means is that when you create a `ScyllaDBMonitoring` resource, {{productName}} will create a `Prometheus`
resource (from the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)) in the same namespace as the `ScyllaDBMonitoring` resource.
This Prometheus instance will be configured to scrape metrics from the ScyllaDB nodes in the cluster that `ScyllaDBMonitoring` is monitoring and
will also have alerting rules configured for ScyllaDB (using `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` CRs).

## Grafana

For deploying Grafana, {{productName}} doesn't use any third-party operator. Instead, it manages the Grafana deployment
directly. It preconfigures Grafana with dashboards from [scylla-monitoring](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-monitoring/).

The Grafana image used in the deployment is tied to the version of {{productName}}. You can find the exact image used in the
[config.yaml](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/blob/master/assets/config/config.yaml) file under `operator.grafanaImage` key.

### Exposing Grafana

{{productName}} creates a `ClusterIP` Service named `<scyllaDBMonitoringName>-grafana` for each `ScyllaDBMonitoring`.
You can access it outside the cluster using your preferred method:

- Port forwarding using `kubectl port-forward` command for temporary access.
- Using [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) or [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
  resources (e.g., HTTPRoute) for production access.

You can learn more about exposing Grafana in the [Exposing Grafana](exposing-grafana.md) guide.
