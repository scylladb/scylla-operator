# Networking

This section covers networking configuration for ScyllaDB clusters.

## Exposing ScyllaDB clusters

For general information about exposing ScyllaDB clusters and configuring network access, see [Exposing ScyllaDB clusters](../../resources/common/exposing.md).

## IPv6 and dual-stack networking

By default, ScyllaDB nodes are connected to each other, and clients connect to ScyllaDB, over an IPv4 network. Alternatively, you can choose IPv6. Refer to the resources below to configure ScyllaDB with IPv6.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 2

ipv6/index
```

For comprehensive IPv6 networking documentation including tutorials, how-to guides, reference material, and concepts, see [IPv6 networking](ipv6/index.md).
