# Upgrading ScyllaDB clusters

Upgrading your ScyllaDB cluster to a newer version is automated by {{productName}} and performed without any downtime.
It is as simple as updating the ScyllaDB image reference in your ScyllaDB cluster specification.

:::{warning}
ScyllaDB version upgrades must be performed consecutively, meaning **you must not skip any major or minor version on the upgrade path**.
Before upgrading to the next version, ensure the entire ScyllaDB cluster has been successfully upgraded.
For details, refer to the [Upgrade procedure in ScyllaDB's documentation](https://enterprise.docs.scylladb.com/stable/upgrade/index.html#upgrade-upgrade-procedures).
:::

:::{caution}
Before upgrading ScyllaDB, ensure the target version is supported by the version of {{productName}} you are using.
Refer to the [support matrix](./../../support/releases.md#support-matrix) for information on version compatibility.

## Upgrade via GitOps (kubectl)

To upgrade your ScyllaDB cluster using GitOps (kubectl), adjust the ScyllaDB image tag/reference to the target one in your ScyllaDB cluster specification and re-apply the manifest.

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} ScyllaCluster
:::{code-block} yaml
:substitutions:

apiVersion: scylla.scylladb.com/v1
kind: ScyllaCluster
metadata:
  name: scylladb
spec:
  version: {{imageTag}} # Specify the target ScyllaDB image tag.
  # ...
:::

After reapplying the manifest, wait for your ScyllaCluster to roll out.

## Upgrade via Helm

:::{important}
{{productName}} does not yet support Helm installation path for managed multi-datacenter ScyllaDB clusters.
:::

To upgrade your ScyllaDB cluster using Helm, upgrade your Helm release with the target ScyllaDB image tag/reference.

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} ScyllaCluster
:::{code-block} shell
:substitutions:

helm upgrade scylla scylla/scylla --reuse-values --set=scyllaImage.tag={{imageTag}}
:::

After upgrading the release, wait for your ScyllaCluster to roll out.
