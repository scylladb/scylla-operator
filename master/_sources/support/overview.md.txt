## Get support

ScyllaDB provides administrators with [paid support](https://www.scylladb.com/product/support/#enterprise-support), including Scylla Operator.

## Troubleshooting issues

To learn more about what to do when issues arise, visit our dedicated [troubleshooting section](troubleshooting/index).

## Gather data about your cluster

Scylla Operator contains an embedded tool called [must-gather](must-gather.md) that can collect the required information for requesting support or reporting issues.
Support requests and bug reports are required to attach the must-gather archive to help us understand the issue.
