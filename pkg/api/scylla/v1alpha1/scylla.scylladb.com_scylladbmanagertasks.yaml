                        parallel specifies the maximum number of ScyllaDB repair jobs that can run at the same time (on different token ranges and replicas).
                        Each node can take part in at most one repair at any given moment. By default, or when set to zero, the maximum possible parallelism is used.
                        The maximal effective parallelism depends on keyspace replication strategy and cluster topology.
