```{warning}
To ensure high availability and fault tolerance in ScyllaDB, it is crucial to **spread your nodes across multiple racks or availability zones**. As a general rule of thumb, you should use **as many racks as your desired replication factor**.

For example, if your replication factor is `3`, deploy your nodes across **3 different racks or availability zones**. This minimizes the risk of data loss and ensures your cluster remains available even if an entire rack or zone fails.
