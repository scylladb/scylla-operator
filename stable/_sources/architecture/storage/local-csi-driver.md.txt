# Local CSI Driver

## About

The Local CSI Driver implements the [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/), a specification for container orchestrators to manage the lifecycle of volumes.

It supports dynamic provisioning on local disks, so storage volumes can be created on-demand through managed directories on the local disk.
