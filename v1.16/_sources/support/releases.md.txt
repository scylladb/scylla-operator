### Backport policy
Usually, only important bug fixes are eligible for being backported.
This may depend on the situation and assessment of the maintainers.

## CI/CD
We use [GitHub actions](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/actions/workflows/go.yaml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush) for our CI/CD. Every merge to a supported branch, or a creation of a tag will automatically trigger a job to build, test and publish the container image and other artifacts like helm charts. Before we publish any image, it must pass the e2e suite.

### Automated promotions

:::{table}
| Git reference      | Type   | Container image                                      |
| :----------------: | :----: | :--------------------------------------------------: |
| **master**         | branch | docker.io/scylladb/scylla-operator:**latest**        |
| **vX.Y**           | branch | docker.io/scylladb/scylla-operator:**X.Y**           |
| **vX.Y.Z**         | tag    | docker.io/scylladb/scylla-operator:**X.Y.Z**         |
| **vX.Y.Z-alpha.N** | tag    | docker.io/scylladb/scylla-operator:**X.Y.Z-alpha.N** |
| **vX.Y.Z-beta.N**  | tag    | docker.io/scylladb/scylla-operator:**X.Y.Z-beta.N**  |

### Generally available
GA images aren't built from scratch but rather promoted from an existing release candidate. When we decide a release candidate has the acceptable quality and QA signs it off, the release candidate is promoted to become the GA release. This ensures that the GA image has exactly the same content and SHA as the tested release candidate.

## Support matrix

The support matrix table shows version requirements for a particular **Scylla Operator** version. Be sure to match these requirements, otherwise some functionality will not work.

### Architectures

{{productName}} image is published as a manifest list to `docker.io/scylladb/scylla-operator:X.Y.Z` containing image build for `amd64` and `aarch64`.

### Supported Kubernetes platforms

We officially test and recommend to use the following platforms:

:::{table}
| Platform         | OS Image     |
|:-----------------|:-------------|
| GKE              | Ubuntu       |
| EKS              | Amazon Linux |
:::

While our APIs generally work on any Kubernetes conformant cluster,
performance tuning and other pieces that need to interact with the host OS, kubelet, CRI, kernel, etc. might hit some incompatibilities.


:::{warning}
The following platforms are known **not to work correctly** at this time.

:::{table}
| Platform         | OS Image     | Details |
|:-----------------|:-------------| :------ |
| GKE              | Container OS |         |
| EKS              | Bottlerocket | Suspected kernel/cgroups issue that breaks available memory detection for ScyllaDB |
